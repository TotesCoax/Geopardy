Double-clicking on each point value will display the question fullscreen
Double-clicking again will remove it from fullscreen and mark it as answered so it no longer displays the money value.
Right clicking on an answered question will remove the answered status and redisplay the money value.

For assigning points, you can click into the point value and either: enter a new amount directly or use the up and down arrows to increment by 100.
You can also use 1-8 keys to increase, shift+1-8 will decrease.
